SYSTEM = Atom: 1     ! label by atomic number
NCORE  = 8           ! number of cores. match slurm script

! output files. needed for data analysis and processing
LWAVE  = T           ! write WAVECAR (true)
LCHARG = T           ! write CHGCAR (true)
LAECHG = T           ! write AECCAR (true) for charge density data

! both values can be set to 1 if re-testing same enviroment (atom) and want to save calculation time (assuming valid WAVECAR and CHGCAR outputs).
ISTART = 0           
ICHARG = 2           ! take superposition of atomic charge densities (default)

ISMEAR = 0           ! use gaussian smearing. highly reccomended for single atom systems
SIGMA  = 0.01        ! width of smearing (eV). ideally small value

! electronic parameters
ENCUT  = 500.00      ! set energy cut-off (eV). should be > ENMAX of all elements being tested
EDIFF  = 1E-06       ! SCF energy convergence (eV). set lower for greater precision, mind computational cost
ISYM   = 0           ! symmetry is off
ISPIN  = 2           ! spin polarized calculations
AMIX = 0.2           
BMIX = 0.0001        
! SCF iteration control
NELMDL = 5           ! delay charge mixing reccomended for atomic calculation. could use testing.
! NELM   = 40            reduced max. could uncomment for efficiency but could also cause problems. 
! NELM                   increased max, can potentially help convergence issues
